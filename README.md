# USCG-Boating-Incidents
Scraping all possible combinations of searches for boating incident reports.

Prompt: 
The USCG (US Coast Guard) publishes on the water incident data, which is accessible for 56 jurisdictions over 13 years across 15 attributes. We would like to use this data in a visualization and need it provided as a CSV/XLSX file with one row per combination of dimension, jurisdiction and year. The web form has three fields and you should iterate through all possible combinations, resulting in an output file with 3 columns (dimension, jurisdiction, year) and 10,920 rows of data.
